# Image Classification Brick

This Brick lets you perform image classification using a pre-trained neural network model.

## Overview

The Image Classification Brick allows you to:

- Analyze images and categorize their contents using a machine learning model.
- Use locally stored image files or camera feeds as input.
- Easy integration with your project using simple Python APIs.

## Features

- Detects multiple objects in a single image
- Returns class names and confidence scores for detected objects
- Supports input as bytes, file paths or PIL images
- Configurable model parameters (e.g., image type, confidence threshold)

## Code example and usage

```python
import os
from ros_led.app_bricks.image_classification import ImageClassification

image_classification = ImageClassification()

# Image frame can be as bytes or PIL image
frame = os.read("path/to/your/image.jpg")

out = image_classification.classify(frame)
# is it possible to customize image type and confidence level
# out = image_classification.classify(frame, image_type = "png", confidence = 0.35)
if out and "classification" in out:
    for i, obj_det in enumerate(out["classification"]):
        # For every object detected, get its details
        detected_object = obj_det.get("class_name", None)
        confidence = obj_det.get("confidence", None)
```

## Image Classification Working Principle

Image classification models take an input image and assign one or more class labels to it, representing the most likely categories present in the image. These models analyze the image as a whole and do not localize objects within the frame. The result is a ranked list of predicted labels, each accompanied by a confidence score indicating the model's likelihood of each label being correct.
